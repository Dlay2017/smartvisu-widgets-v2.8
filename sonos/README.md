**Description:**
- SmartVISU widget to control Sonos(r) speakers with FHEM/Fronthem.

**Features:**
- Control groups, play/radio lists, track position, volume, mute, play, stop, skip, ...
- Popup with equalizer and volume slider for neighbour players

**Important update note:**
- If your are updating from version **0.85** or below, you have to replace a notify and delete a userReadings definition. See change log blow.

**Requirements:**
- Fully functioning FHEM (at least version 9118, 2015-08-23) with configured Sonos modules
- SmartVISU **2.8+** (https://github.com/Martin-Gleiss/smartvisu)
- Fronthem (https://github.com/herrmannj/fronthem)
- ~~FHEM Sonos player device names without umlauts or underscores in room name. A underscore between prefix and room name is needed on the other hand.~~
~~If you are affected then rename your player(s), please. Otherwise you can try to change regexs in notifies and subs in 99_fronthemSonosUtils.pm.~~

**Installation advices:**

**FHEM:**
- Copy 99_fronthemSonosUtils.pm to your FHEM module folder (typically /opt/fhem/FHEM).
- Check that file has the same permission as all other files in this directory.
- Restart FHEM.
- **UPDATED:** Define 2 FHEM notifies (replace "Sonos_" by your used prefix, if you named it differently):
```
define n_sv_sonosGroups notify Sonos_.*[^(_LR|_RR|_LF|_RF|_SW)]:currentTrackProvider:.\w.* { sv_setSonosGroupsReadings($NAME, $EVENT) }
```
```
define n_sv_sonosTransportState notify Sonos_.*[^(_LR|_RR|_LF|_RF|_SW)]:transportState:.* { sv_SonosTransportStateChanged($NAME,$EVTPART1) }
```
- Do not forget to save.

**smartVISU:**
- Copy widget_ddtlabs_sonos.* to your smartVISU pages folder.
- Copy content of *.css and *.js to your visu.css/visu.js or include it in any other way.
- Copy sonos_empty.jpg to smartvisu_root/pages/base/pics (typically /var/www/smartvisu/pages/base/pics).
- Copy icons/.* to smartvisu ws icon folder (typically /var/www/smartvisu/icons/ws).
- Check that permissions of all copied files are correct.

**Icons:**
- Each Sonos player can build a group with its neighbours. Icons that are used for that purpose must be named in this way: my_audio_group_[playername].svg
- eg. one of your Sonos player is named "Sonos_Livingroom" then your icon for that room must be named "my_audio_group_Sonos_Livingroom.svg".
- You can use any smartVISU compatible svg icon. Some icons are included that display the first character of the room name. The character can simple be changed with a text editor of your choice (last line in svg). Position of this character can be adjusted in x/y lines above.
- Check that permissions of all copied/created files are correct.

**Example widget call** for two players (eg. for rooms_*.html or category_*.html):

```

- Group / ungroup your players in all possible combinations with FHEM or Sonos Controller while FHEM is running. Dynamic readings will be created.

**Fronthem converter usage:**
  - **SonosGroup:** used for all svHasClient_Sonos_.* and svIsInAnyGroup readings (these FHEM readings will automatically be created at first when Sonos speakers are grouped)
  - **SonosAlbumArtURL:** used for currentAlbumArtURL reading (inter alia fixing a FHEM Sonos module bug)
  - **SonosTrackPos:** used for svTrackPosition reading
  - **SonosTransportState:** used for transportState.* reading
  - **NumDirect:** used for Volume reading
  - **Direct:** used for all other readings
  - Some readings may not be displayed in FHEM Gad Editor because they are not on Sonos modules internal setList. Enter them nevertheless.
  - Last part of gad/items names that are displayed in gad editor are the reading names that must be selected for each reading and cmd. I hope that makes this configuration a little bit easier.

**Used Sonos player readings:**
  - can be found in the beginning of sonos player macro in widget_ddtlabs_sonos.html
  - some additional readings are created dynamically based on Sonos neighbours within Sonos players.
    - eg. svHasClient_Sonos_Livingroom, svHasClient_Sonos_Kitchen, ...

**Debugging:**
- Enable at least verbose 4 and have a look at 99_fronthemSonosUtils.pm for disabled Log3 and main::Log3 lines and enable them. reload 99_fronthemSonosUtils

**Uninstall:**
- Remove additional userReading svTrackPosition from all Sonos players (if defined in earlier version).
- Delete both created notifies within FHEM.
- Call within FHEM {sv_SonosReadingsDelete()} to delete all addional created readings within Sonos players.
- Delete all copied files.
- Say quite and sad: bye bye ;-)

**Note** on using "ddtlabs" in file names and css statements:
- I decided to use a unique prefix name to be sure to not collide with other widgets.

**ToDo:**
- Remove continously currentTrackPosition update and replace it with a timerEvent() js function. **Voluntaries up, please!**
- ~~Popup with sliders for treble, bass, balance and other settings.~~
- Get radio and play lists from FHEM readings.
- ~~Dynamic layout in width.~~

**Update notes:**
- If 99_fronthemSonosUtils.pm was replaced, then restart FHEM. "Reload 99_fronthemSonosUtils" could no be enough in some cases!
- See change log for instructions.
